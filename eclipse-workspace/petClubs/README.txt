Hello dear user, I really hope you are enjoying CLUBS4PETS.
Here is a recommendation from the creator (me) to you =D

If you rather use smaller files (500 clients and 1000 pets), you must do this:



Go to class Club.java, and change line number 29 for: public final static String CLUBSCSV = "dataTest/Clubs.csv"; 

Go to class Person.java, and change line number 31 for: public final static String PEOPLECSV = "dataTest/People.csv";

Go to class Pet.java, and change line number 33 for: public final static String PETSCSV = "dataTest/Pets.csv"; 

(Copy the chain I give you here after the ":" and paste it over the whole line I specifically tell you)



I strongly suggest you to use this files instead of the default ones if you wanna use the program fast, otherwise you will need to spend some time (more than 2 hours) waiting until the computer loads every single file, and probably another good time while you do stuff within the program.

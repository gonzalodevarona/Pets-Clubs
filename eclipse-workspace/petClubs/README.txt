Hello dear user, I really hope you are enjoying CLUBS4PETS.
Here is a recommendation from the creator (me) to you =D

If you rather use smaller files (500 clients and 1000 pets), you must do this:



Go to class Club.java, and change line number 29 for: public final static String CLUBSCSV = "dataTest/Clubs.csv"; 

Go to class Person.java, and change line number 31 for: public final static String PEOPLECSV = "dataTest/People.csv";

Go to class Pet.java, and change line number 33 for: public final static String PETSCSV = "dataTest/Pets.csv"; 

(Copy the chain I give you here after the ":" and paste it over the whole line I specifically tell you)



I strongly suggest you to use this files instead of the default ones if you wanna use the program fast, otherwise you will need to spend some time (more than 2 hours) waiting until the computer loads every single file, and probably another good time while you do stuff within the program.

UPDATE: The program does not take too long loading the 1 million objects, but it does when it sorts or makes search, so I highly recommend you to test the program with the dataTest csv, please take a desition before you launch the program, if you decide to change the csvs, every single csv loaded in the program must be from the same package, otherwise, the program will make a mix between the 1 million objects and the amount of objects for testing.
